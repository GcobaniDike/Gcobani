          I'am the Founder of this organization, a board member and chairperson. In 2017 I saw that the children are struggling to do their school work because of their
          backgrounds. others are staying with their grandmothers who can't help their grandchildren when it comes to their school work because of the syllabus has changed
          other parents come home later so they don't have time to help their children with school work. That is why Zamukhanyo was formed weth the slogan that is famously known now in our community,
          which is Better Education Better Future. I wanted to lay the foundation in the early grades to prepare them for high school. Funda Helping Program assist the young generation of philippi
          through education which right now is a demand that is needed.
